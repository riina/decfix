# decfix

Hacknet save patcher that re-encodes DEC files for use on each Hacknet platform.

Useful if you want to play a save on multiple platforms (unnecessary if
you're only playing on one platform or playing on only macOS and Linux).

## Usage

On Windows, drag your save file onto the executable and the file will be re-coded for
Windows and/or mono (macOS and Linux) next to the save file, depending on whether
conversion is needed.

```
Usage:
  decfix <save-file> [options]

Arguments:
  <save-file>  Save file to create patched versions of

Options:
  -p, --password-file <password-file>        Password file (containing JSON array of strings)
  -o, --output-directory <output-directory>  Directory to output
  --version                                  Show version information
  -?, -h, --help                             Show help and usage information
```

## Information

If a file is already encoded in one platform's format (i.e. no DEC files seem to use
any other platform's password encoding), a new file will not be created for that platform.

If a password for the file cannot be found, the file's contents and header
information are re-written in plaintext.

Files that contain mixed hash algorithm usages are processed correctly
(program purely checks if hash is known).

Hash collisions result in the program defaulting to the first password stored
in a hash set (arbitrary). Hacknet and Hacknet Labyrinths do not have any collisions.

All in-game passwords (Labyrinths included) are already stored internally.
An additional password JSON file can be added, as generated by the
Java-based PassScan (project unavailable, just need JSON array), meant for
use by extensions.
